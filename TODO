Vedant (branch ik-fast)
- implement camera lock
- speed up ik if possible
- geometrically convergent goal points
- test with more time-variant surfaces
- make sure the torso never escapes the support polygon
- make goal points closer to the body
- ik constraints; clamping in updatePosition(delta)
- inline partialDerivative()
- give up before you actually reach the goal to avoid problems with slow convergence
- make sure we stay on top of the surface

Future
- turning while walking
- acceleration + gravity
- jumping
- multiple surfaces
- pickups
- lazers
- lagrange multipliers for constraints
- Lighting, smooth shading.
- Environment maps + reflections.
