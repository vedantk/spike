TURNING WHILE WALKING
LAZERRRS
ACCELERATION BONUSES
PICKUPS

Perfect creature rendering
- Move the creature.

IK
- Model of creature walking.
- Center of mass computation.
- Stable walking on unstable surfaces.

Dealing with IK Constraints
1. Don't deal with them.
2. Run standard IK (theta = J.inverse() * position.delta()), clamp results.
3. Again run standard IK, but project results onto the constraint boundary (this may be marginally more intelligent than doing clamping).
4. Use Lagrange multipliers.

Extras
- Acceleration of the creature.
- Jumping.
- Adding multiple creatures to the scene, focus switching.
- Rendering multiple surfaces, jumping between surfaces.
- Gravity.

Special effects
- Lighting, smooth shading.
- Environment maps + reflections.
- Define a suite of varying surfaces.
